For a Genpact interview related to ReactJS, it's essential to have a good grasp of both fundamental concepts and more advanced topics. Here are some important topics you should focus on:
===============REACT JS======================
React Basics:-------------

JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax
Components (Functional and Class components)
Props and state
Event handling
Conditional rendering
Lists and keys
Hooks:-------------

useState
useEffect
useContext
Custom hooks

Component Lifecycle:--------------------------
Class component lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount)
Effect hook (useEffect)
State Management:-----------------------

Context API for state management
Redux (basic understanding if applicable)
Routing:--------------------------
React Router (setting up routes, nested routes, route parameters)


Forms:----------------------------
Controlled vs. Uncontrolled components
Form handling in React
HTTP Requests:

Fetch API or libraries like Axios for making HTTP requests
Handling API responses (async/await)

Styling in React:---------------------------
CSS Modules
Styled-components or other CSS-in-JS solutions
Error Handling:

Error boundaries
Handling errors in asynchronous code

Performance Optimization:---------------
Memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
Virtual DOM and its importance

Testing:--------------------------
Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
Snapshot testing

Advanced React Patterns:---------------------
Higher-order components (HOCs)
Render props
Compound components

Deployment:--------------------------------
Build process with tools like Webpack or Create React App
Deployment strategies

Best Practices and Design Patterns:----------------------
Separation of concerns
Component reusability
Code organization


Latest React Features:---------------------------------------
Concurrent Mode and Suspense
React Router v6 (if applicable)

=======================================================================================
Explain the concept of Virtual DOM in React.js and how it improves performance.

Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM, maintained by React. When state or props change, React compares the virtual DOM with the previous version and only updates the real DOM where necessary. This minimizes browser reflows and improves performance.
What are the differences between state and props in React?

Props (Properties): Props are read-only data that are passed from parent components to child components. They are used to communicate and configure components.
State: State is mutable data that is managed internally by a component. It can be changed by the component itself using setState(), and when state changes, React re-renders the component.
How does React Router work, and what are its primary components?

React Router is a popular library for routing in React applications, allowing navigation between different views or pages. It uses a component-based approach where different components are rendered based on the URL.
Primary components of React Router:
BrowserRouter: Uses HTML5 history API to keep UI in sync with the URL.
Route: Declares a mapping between a URL path and a component to render.
Link/NavLink: Used for navigation between different routes. NavLink provides styling options based on the current URL.


===============================TYPESCRIPT================================================

1) Basics of TypeScript:--------------------
Type annotations and type inference
Basic types: string, number, boolean, arrays, tuples, enums, any, void, null, undefined
Type assertions

2) Interfaces and Types:-------------------------------------------------
#)Creating and using interfaces :- In TypeScript, interfaces are used to define the structure of an object. They allow you to specify the properties and methods that an object must have. Interfaces are purely a compile-time construct and are used for type-checking during development.
Creating Interfaces::
You define an interface using the interface keyword followed by the interface name:
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
    greet: () => void;
}


#) Differences between interfaces and types :- 
Optional properties and readonly properties

3) Advanced Types:----------------------------
Union types and intersection types
Type guards and type narrowing
Conditional types (using extends)

4) Functions in TypeScript:----------------------------
Typing function parameters and return types
Optional and default parameters
Function overloading


5) Classes and OOP in TypeScript:----------------------------------
Creating classes with typed properties and methods
Access modifiers (public, private, protected)
Abstract classes and interfaces


6) Generics:---------------------------------
Basics of generics and type parameters
Generic functions, classes, and interfaces
Constraints with generics

7) Type Inference and Declaration Files:--------------------------------
Understanding how TypeScript infers types
Using declaration files (.d.ts) for third-party libraries


8) Enums:------------------------------
Creating enums and their use cases
String enums and computed enums

9)Modules and Namespaces:-----------------------------------------------
Import and export syntax in TypeScript
Using namespaces for organizing code (though modules are generally preferred)


10) TypeScript with React:-------------------------------
Setting up TypeScript in a React project (e.g., Create React App with TypeScript)
Typing props and state in functional and class components
Using generics in React components
Context API with TypeScript


11) TypeScript Tooling:---------------------------
Configuring tsconfig.json for a project
TypeScript compiler options and their significance
Integrating TypeScript with popular IDEs (VS Code, WebStorm, etc.)


12) Advanced TypeScript Features:------------------------------
Type aliases and type literals
keyof and mapped types
Utility types (Partial, Required, Pick, etc.)
Using unknown and never types effectively


13) TypeScript and JavaScript Interoperability:--------------------------------
Using @ts-ignore and @ts-nocheck pragmas when necessary
Type definitions for existing JavaScript libraries (via DefinitelyTyped or writing your own)


14) Error Handling and Debugging in TypeScript:---------------------
Handling type errors and common pitfalls
Debugging TypeScript code effectively


15) Best Practices:------------------
Writing clean and maintainable TypeScript code
Using TypeScript to enforce strict typing and improve code quality
